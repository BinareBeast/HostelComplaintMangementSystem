# HostelComplaintMangementSystem
This is an android application for complaint log register for hostel students developed in android studio using java.
Here we have separate login activity for both students and staff with their registered  login credentials. Once the student loged in  the they can raise their complaint in the student activity if its submitted then it will update in firebase and pull from it to the staff activity to address the issue to rectify.
